# ❌⭕ Tic Tac Toe AI (Unbeatable)

A Python-based Tic Tac Toe game featuring an unbeatable AI powered by the **Minimax Algorithm** with **Alpha-Beta Pruning** optimization. Built with a clean **Tkinter** GUI.

## 🌟 Overview
This project is not just a game; it's an implementation of classic Game Theory concepts. The AI evaluates all possible future moves to ensure it never loses. It serves as a practical demonstration of search algorithms in Artificial Intelligence.

## 🚀 Features
- **Unbeatable AI:** Powered by the Minimax algorithm.
- **Optimized Performance:** Implements **Alpha-Beta Pruning** to reduce the search space and speed up decision-making.
- **Interactive GUI:** User-friendly interface built with Python's `Tkinter`.
- **Player Selection:** Choose to play as 'X' or 'O'.
- **Smart Logic:** The game detects wins, draws, and automatically switches turns.

## 🧠 AI Implementation
The core of this project relies on two major algorithms:
1.  **Minimax Algorithm:** A recursive algorithm used for decision-making in game theory.
2.  **Alpha-Beta Pruning:** An optimization technique for the minimax algorithm that cuts off branches in the game tree that don't need to be searched, making the AI faster without losing accuracy.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **GUI Library:** Tkinter (Standard Python Library)
- **Concepts:** Recursion, Game Trees, Heuristics.
